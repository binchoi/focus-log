# Log Your Focus

Inspired by the concept of 'Focus Logs' introduced in [Ali Abdaal's YouTube video](https://youtu.be/W2afI0n8pUk?si=H0lipwA2McRDeNSI&t=779), I created this project to help track my focus sessions and make consistent progress toward my 2025 goals.

## Motivation

Initially, I used a **physical notebook** to log my focus sessions. Later, I transitioned to a **Google Spreadsheet**, which allowed for better organization but proved cumbersome in practice. The process of locating the spreadsheet, logging in, and manually entering data disrupted my workflow. I wanted a **simple, one-click solution** to log focus sessions effortlessly from both my phone and computer.

One frustrated evening, I built this web application that simplifies focus logging. So far, it does the job!

## What's Next?

Currently, the app is being used by myself and a few friends. 
Each user sets up their own Google Spreadsheet by duplicating a provided template and manually entering their focus goals. 
Additionally, the app relies on a shared service account to support the Google Sheets API, which limits scalability. 
To accommodate a growing user base, I plan to enhance the user registration and management system for greater efficiency and scalability.


Additionally, I am planning to add visualizations + insight discovery features to further assist users in their journey towards their goals.
